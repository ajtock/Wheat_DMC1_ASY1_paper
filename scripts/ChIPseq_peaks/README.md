# ChIP-seq peak definition, processing and analysis

Numbered scripts in this subdirectory were run sequentially to define and process peaks in ChIP-seq signal.

Scripts for evaluating ChIP-seq peak overlaps with other features, using the Bioconductor package [regioneR](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/regioneR.html), are located in [overlaps/](https://github.com/ajtock/Wheat_DMC1_ASY1_paper/tree/master/scripts/ChIPseq_peaks/motifs_summits200bp/).

Scripts for identifying enriched DNA sequence motifs among ChIP-seq peaks, using [Weeder 2.0](http://www.beaconlab.it/modtools), are in [motifs\_summits200bp/](https://github.com/ajtock/Wheat_DMC1_ASY1_paper/tree/master/scripts/ChIPseq_peaks/motifs_summits200bp/).
