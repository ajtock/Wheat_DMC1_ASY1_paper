# ChIP-seq peak recombination rate (cM/Mb) quantiles

This subdirectory contains the R script `group_peaks_into_cMMb_quantiles.R` for dividing ChIP-seq peaks into four groups corresponding to those within the 100th--75th (Quantile 1), 75th--50th (Quantile 2), 50th--25th (Quantile 3) and 25th--0th (Quantile 4) percentiles with regard to their mean crossover recombination rate (cM/Mb) values, derived from a Chinese Spring $\times$ Renan genetic map.
This script extends ChIP-seq peak boundaries by 1 kb on each side, and computes mean cM/Mb values within these intervals using previously calculated mean recombination rates in 10-Mb sliding windows with a 1-Mb step (`iwgsc_refseqv1.0_recombination_rate.txt`, available as part of the [IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 annotation](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/download/iwgsc/IWGSC_RefSeq_Annotations/v1.0/)).
`group_peaks_into_cMMb_quantiles.R` requires peak coordinates and, separately, random locus coordinates in BED6 format: column 1 = chromosome ID; column 2 = 0-based start coordinate; column 3 = 1-based end coordinates; column 4 = sequential or otherwise unique numbers (this will speed up computation; see comment from dpryan79 on 13/09/2018 under GitHub issue [computeMatrix has problem with multi processors #760](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools/issues/760)]); column 5 = fill with NA; column 6 = fill with \*.
