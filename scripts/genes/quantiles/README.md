# Gene quantiles

This subdirectory contains the R script `group_genes_into_quantiles_and_popgenetics.R` for dividing genes into groups corresponding to those in given percentile ranges (e.g., the 100th--75th (Quantile 1), 75th--50th (Quantile 2), 50th--25th (Quantile 3) and 25th--0th (Quantile 4)) with regard to various ordering factors, such as mean crossover recombination rate (cM/Mb) values, derived from a Chinese Spring Ã— Renan genetic map, ChIP-seq signal, or population genetics statistics.
This script extends gene boundaries by 1 kb on each side, and computes mean cM/Mb values within these intervals using previously calculated mean recombination rates in 10-Mb sliding windows with a 1-Mb step (`iwgsc_refseqv1.0_recombination_rate.txt`, available as part of the [IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 annotation](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/download/iwgsc/IWGSC_RefSeq_Annotations/v1.0/)).
`group_genes_into_quantiles_and_popgenetics.R` requires coordinates for representative gene models from the [IWGSC RefSeq v1.1 annotation](https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/download/iwgsc/IWGSC_RefSeq_Annotations/v1.1/) and, separately, random loci in BED6 format: column 1 = chromosome ID; column 2 = 0-based start coordinates; column 3 = 1-based end coordinates; column 4 = sequential or otherwise unique numbers (this speeds up computation; see comment from dpryan79 on 13/09/2018 under GitHub issue [computeMatrix has problem with multi processors #760](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools/issues/760)]); column 5 = fill with NA; column 6 = strand.
To compute population genetics statistics for each gene, this script also requires a variant call format (VCF) file containing ~3 million exome sequencing-derived SNP sites ([all.GP08_mm75_het3_publication01142019.vcf.gz](http://wheatgenomics.plantpath.ksu.edu/1000EC/)), with geographical information about each accession obtained from [He et al. (2019) *Nat. Genet.* **51**. DOI: 10.1038/s41588-019-0382-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-019-0382-2).


`gene_quantile_metaprofiles.R` calculates and plots metaprofiles of ChIP-seq, MNase-seq and RNA-seq signals, DNA methylation proportions, and SNP and transposon frequencies (gene windowed means and 95% confidence intervals, CIs) for each group of genes, defined either by decreasing recombination rate, for example, or randomly.

`gene_quantile_cMMb_density_mean_95CI_plot.R` plots density and means with 95% CIs of recombination rate for each group of genes.
